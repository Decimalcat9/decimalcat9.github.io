    <h2> I like to play video games, read comics, and love to listen to music on my free time. </h2>
    <h3>My favorite band is Approaching Nirvana</h3>
    <h3> The video game I've been playing a lot lately has been Overwatch </h3>
    <h3>The last comic I bought was issue 1-4 of Steven Universe and The Crystal Gems </h3>
