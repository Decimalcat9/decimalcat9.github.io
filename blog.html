  <h2><p>How to make a webpage </p></h2>
  <center><h3><p>With all the custom webpage makers out there making it easier for people to make their own webpages by just dragging and dropping items they want there is no reason for someone to not make a webpage</p></h3></center>
  <center><h3><p>That's why I'm going to be showing three web makers but only two will be drag and drop while the last one will be a little more tricky by having to write everything in HTML</p></h3></center>

   <h1>cloud9</h1>
   <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;"><li>Out of every website builder, I have tried by far my favorite had to be cloud9 because it gives me 100% creative liberty. It even lets me create my own domain name. The only problem with it would be it is not built for beginners you will need to know at least HTML to start.</li></p>
   <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;"><li>So to start what your going to need is to set up a Cloud 9 account I'll leave a link here to their website so that way you don't have to search for it </li></p>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://c9.io/?redirect=0">"Cloud 9"</a>
   <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;"><li>The second thing you'll need is a GitHub account here is a link to their website</li></p>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">"github"</a>
   <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;"><li>I also recommend checking out  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> "W3Schools.com"</a>just in case you don't understand something or just want to learn more about HTML , CSS or javascript.In no way am I affiliated or sponsored by W3Schools</li></p>

     <h1>weebly</h1>
     <p><h3>Weebly is more of a user-friendly web-hosting service because of its drag-and-drop features it's really good for beginners and for anyone who wants to make a quick website  , but it does have its limitations, Weebly doesn't give you give the user a lot of customization abilities it seems like if a person wants to make a more customised and unique website they have to pay for Weebly's premium addition which gives the user a lot more tools to work with. So overall its an ok website maker but there is another website maker that is a lot better.</h3></p>

       <h1>Wix</h1>
       <p><h3>Wix is completely free a gives you way more customization options than Weebly does but depending on how you look at that it could be a good thing for you or it coulld be a nightmare for you </h3></p>
       <p><h3>The good part about Wix is that it welcomes both new comers and old by greeting you with two options when you start you. You could either have Wix hold your hand and make suggestions to you as you build your own personalized website and learn to use Wix. Or you could go in blind and play around if you know what your doing already. A good part about Wix is that it has a numers number of templets to chooce from that's what makes Wix a great web builder for </h3></p>
